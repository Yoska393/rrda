Hi Tristan and Julie,

Thank you for your collaboration towards the development of rrda package.

Here I store all the script for the simulations and applications, and my own functions used for the analysis. 

I have tried my best to do an "efficient" writing but if you find anything to improve, could you leave a note? 

Also, all the application data is stored as .rds file in a folder (RDAdata), which is available here

The draft of article is available here

Merci beaucoup,
