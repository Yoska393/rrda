## ðŸ‘€ Overview

Hello / Bonjour! ðŸ‘‹

This R package `rrda` provides functions for performing **ridge redundancy analysis (rrda)**, which is useful for modeling the relationship between a matrix of response variables (**Y**; n Ã— q ) and a matrix of explanatory variables (**X**;  n Ã— p ). The method is designed to handle **high-dimensional data efficiently**, allowing computation and storage optimization.


Also, I store all the scripts and my own functions used in our article (Yoshioka et al. 2025). 

## ðŸ›  Installation

You can install the package from GitHub using the `devtools` package:

```r
devtools::install_github("Yoska393/rrda", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

- `RSpectra`
- `furrr`
- `dplyr`
- `reshape2`
- `ggplot2`

## ðŸ“Š Data

For the application data, the data for breast cancer (Witten et al., 2009) and soybean data (Dang et al., 2023) are stored on this page. Also, refer to Ruiz-Arenas and GonzÃ¡lez 2020) for the methylation data. 

The application data of breast cancer and soybean are stored as .rds file in a folder (RDAdata). For methylation data, you can refer to the R package (MEAL, Ruiz-Arenas and GonzÃ¡lez 2024)

The metabolome data were downloaded from the RIKEN DropMet website (http://prime.psc.riken.jp/menta.cgi/prime/drop_index) ; ID: DM0071, DM0072.

## ðŸ”§ Tutorial

#### Example 1: Fitting

`rdasim1` function generates rank-restricted matrices X and Y. 

```r
library(rrda)
set.seed(123)
simdata <- rdasim1(n = 10, p = 20, q = 20, k = 5)
X <- simdata$X
Y <- simdata$Y
```
`rrda.fit` function solves the rrda (ridge redundancy) for X and Y. 
This is equivalent to the prediction from X to Y, where Y = XB + E.

`nrank` indicates the rank restrictions for the model. Here, it is the value of 1 to 5.

`lambda` indicates the ridge penalty for the model. Here, it is the value of 0.1, 1, 10.   

The model solves several ranks and lambdas efficiently. In this case, the model returns all the combinations of ranks and lambdas (3 times 5 = 15).

```r
Bhat <- rrda.fit(Y = Y, X = X, nrank = c(1:5), lambda = c(0.1,1,10))
names(Bhat)
```

When you see the Bhat, you will see the list composed of each lambda. In each lambda value, you have the coefficient `B` according to each rank.

Note! The Bhat is stored in a decomposed form. This is because the function is designed for high-dimensional settings.

If you want to have a matrix form of B, you can perform:

```r
Bhat_mat1 <- rrda.coef(Bhat = Bhat)
```

If you want to specify the rank or lambda, you may indicate as below
```r
Bhat_mat2 <- rrda.coef(Bhat = Bhat, nrank = 5, lambda= 1)
```

Maybe a heatmap can explain the variable relationships

```r
heatmap(Bhat_mat2$lambda1$rank5)
#heatmap(Bhat_mat2[[1]][[1]]) # same result
```
Don't forget to specify the location of the matrix in the list 

#### Example 2: Parameter Tuning by Cross-Validation

```r
set.seed(123)
simdata <- rdasim1(n = 100, p = 200, q = 200, k = 5)
X <- simdataÃ—X
Y <- simdataÃ—Y

# Complete Example
cv_result <- rrda.cv(Y = Y, X = X, maxrank = 10) # cv
rrda.summary(cv_result = cv_result) # cv result

# Plot the CV result
p <- rrda.plot(cv_result)
print(p)

# Heatmap of the CV result
h <- rrda.heatmap(cv_result)
print(h)

# Extract optimal parameters
estimated_lambda <- cv_resultÃ—opt_minÃ—lambda
estimated_rank <- cv_resultÃ—opt_minÃ—rank

# Fit the model with the optimal parameters
Bhat <- rrda.fit(Y = Y, X = X, nrank = estimated_rank, lambda = estimated_lambda)
Bhat_mat <- rrda.coef(Bhat)

# Make predictions
Yhat_mat <- rrda.predict(Bhat = Bhat, X = X)
Yhat <- Yhat_mat[[1]][[1]][[1]]

# Correlation
cor_Y_Yhat <- diag(cor(Y, Yhat))
summary(cor_Y_Yhat)
```
